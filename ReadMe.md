# Helena Mahinay




> After graduation, I see myself starting as a software engineer. While working, I will continue studying to further hone my skills and expand my knowledge. After a few years, I aim to transition from a software engineer to a software architect. During these years, I will focus on preparing myself to make project-specific software design decisions, coordinate technical teams, and establish and enforce coding standards to create software that meets business goals. Once I have saved enough money, I plan to start my own digital agency, where I can work in a way that aligns with my standards and vision.


> My interests include designing, content creation, and music. I enjoy exploring creative processes, whether through digital design or just listening to music. These activities allow me to express my ideas and tap into my artistic side.


> In my free time, I also indulge in hobbies like gaming, watching various shows or movies, and baking. These hobbies help me relax and unwind, offering a balance to my more focused creative pursuits.
